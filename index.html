                        <h2>London</h2>
                        <p>In London we paid &pound30 for a tour on a double decker bus that drove
                            us all around London. We saw Big Ben, Buckingham Palace, the Tower of
                            London, St. Paul's Cathedral, the London Eye, and so much more.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Woking</h2>
                        <p>We stayed at an Air BNB just outside London in a town called Woking. We ate a 
                            pub called the 'The Jovial Sailor' and visited Wisley Botanical Garden.

                        <h2>Cornwall</h2>
                        <p>On our drive to Cornwall we passed Stonehenge. In Cornwall we visited the
                            Lost Gardens of Heligan, a botanical garden that was closed after WW I 
                            and didn't reopen for over 50 years. The area where this garden is in
                            a tropical climate and is a big vacation destination.

                        <h2>Edinburgh</h2>
                        <p>In Edinburgh, Scotland we went on a distillery tour, did a walking
                            tour of the city, saw some areas where Harry Potter was filmed,
                            went through Edinburgh Castle, and went to a few pubs.

                        <p>In York we went to the huge York Minster Cathedral, toured a Castle
                            that people actually live in and allowed some filming for a couple
                            early Harry Potter movies, and went to Alnwick Gardens.
